# Enstream
This is the OA assignment from Enstream. This project involves a website scraper designed to retrieve price information based on the [Type Allocation Code (TAC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_Allocation_Code#:~:text=The%20Type%20Allocation%20Code%20TAC,to%20uniquely%20identify%20wireless%20devices) of a device. It then presents this data in a visualized format.

Note: This project utilizes a .csv database sourced online, implying that the data may be obsolete. (Utilizing a RealTime API would incur excessive costs.)
